				<h2>Why is this needed?</h2>
				<h3>
					The recent app update to TCGplayer has got everyone messed up.
					It's slow, it's buggy, it's unreliable, and is now one of the most quickly 1-star reviewed app among apps on the Google Play Store. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tcgplayer.tcgplayer">You should definitely take a look at the reviews on the Google Play Store, it's glorious.</a>
				</h3>

				<h2>What can I do?</h2>
				<h3>
					I've ripped a copy of TCGplayer off a friend's phone that was still running the pre-enshittification version of TCGplayer, and put it on my website for anyone to download. If you don't trust this upload, you can use tools such as Lucky Patcher to make your own backups of old app versions (somewhat advanced).
				</h3>

				<h2>There's a review topic named "absolute trash" now! Enjoy these tasteful 1-star reviews.</h2>

						Just got the update and man I wish I didn't. This has got to be the worst update ever in the history of updates. It's completely unusable now. It makes 0 sense. It doesn't scan cards right. Takes multiple times to scan. You can't change the card type after it's scanned, so if it scans wrong you have to delete and enter it manually. You don't have an easy-to-scroll list anymore. Why did they change it? I'll never understand companies that break things that were never broken.

						<b>Alijandro Mendiola - August 12, 2025</b><br>
						I work at a card shop and TCGplayers recent update has only made it much more difficult to scan and look up cards via the app. we used to have a feature that allowed us to correct printing if the scanner did not give the right printing but now its not even an option and the pop up option that brings up all the different prints will barely register a tap. I have a lot more complaints about the recent update but 500 characters isnt enough to go over it all. I will not be using this app until fixed

						<b>Daniel Skiffen - August 5, 2025</b><br>
						I used this app for years to scan and price my mtg cards. Then with the overhaul update it went from being easy to use to a nightmare. I would scan a card and then be unable to find or let alone edit it to make it the right card set. It would say you had to go to your list to edit and change the variant but that was not true. The worst part, is all my lists and cards I had scanned are gone!!! lost!!! I sadly will be uninstalling this app and finding something else. I wish everyone else good luck

						<b>Frank N - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						The new version is horrible! Unable to change the pricing point from market to median. More than half of the cards now show N/A for pricing. Collections that were valued at over $15,000 are now saying $7,000 because there is no pricing for them. I used to love this app, but this latest update makes it virtually useless! Update: I wish I could take away the one star! This version is horrendous! Found an APK of the old version and going to install that and lock it down so it can't be upgraded.

						<b>Andrew Mayo - August 9, 2025</b><br>
						This app is absolute TRASH after the recent update. First it deleted all the collections I had, and then while scanning for a new collection it crashed and deleted the 50+ cards I had scanned. Not to mention the scanning is atrocious and doesn't work half the time and when it does it doesn't choose the right variant of card or let you change it easily. If you can find a different card scanner app I recommend it

						<b>MARK GAUTNEY - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						Current version as of 8/01/25 is horrible compared to previous version. It currently does not allow me select specific versions of cards it caps at 10 variants. Prices are not changing when high, medium, or low are selected. This was an app I used daily and loved but now it takes so much more time and will not import list from texts. The previous version I was fully supporting and used in my job at my lgs has slowed our productivity down to a crawl.

						<b>mathinia - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						New update sucks. Got rid of the collection I alrdy had on my phone. The ui change is just ugly to look at. When manually searching for cards it won't leave the screen, keeps adding cards for how many times you've hit the "done" button. I have to close the app to leave the search screen. Why was a major overhaul needed for an update, when the previous version was perfect?

						<b>Tommy Greenburg - August 6, 2025</b><br>
						App is now worse than ever honestly less than 1 star if it was possible scanner rarely works,essentially card options than before, harder to find cards, says it supports all languages yet doesn't, and the new layout basically makes it useless

						<b>Colin LaFerle - August 29, 2018 <i>(Edited July 18, 2025)</i></b><br>
						Certain features need to be better/exist. How can you not have a sorting feature for your collection? Also, importing a csv is a disaster. There is no discernable way to load the file. Update: 7 years and the scanner AND search functions are worse somehow. I have since found several better solutions, but kept this around for quick list access. I'm not even sure I'll be doing that anymore.

					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Ashley Urban - July 27, 2025</b><br>
						I have loved using this app for the past few years. But after the latest update I strongly dislike it. Everytime you open your collection you have to sort it how you want, it doesn't stay. It takes me 3 times as long to make a list or even just look up a single card. You pretty much have to type in exactly the card you want now because it only brings up about 6 options. I also really dislike the big pictures for the collections. The 3 cards in one frame is extremely distracting/overwhelming.

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Melinda H - August 13, 2025</b><br>
						No accurate prices on cards anymore. Each time I select MP low it just returns to market price average. There's no dark mode, searching cards is a nightmare. I can no longer have it in list form because the only way you can see information for accurate card pricing is to have the images in tile setting. It automatically starts me out in the shop and it reorganizes the order of my lists every time I close the app. It's visually offensive, inaccurate, frustrating, and not made with user in mind.

						<b>Aaron Shifflett - August 8, 2025</b><br>
						The scanner barely works, if at all for anything holographic. When trying to buy items the filter options disappear sometimes. Like when you're wanting to choose regular, reverse holo or holo you'll sometimes only get 2 of those options. Also the "Remember this device" option when logging in does nothing, you still have to fill out your name and password every time. It would also be very useful if you could sort by set number when browsing to buy, but you can't.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Ben Driver - August 7, 2025</b><br>
						The new scan and track app doesn't really have a good export option. All you get is a "Share" option to send your collection as a text or email. Also when you scan new cards to your collection, it doesn't automatically add them, you have to manually click the few buttons on the phone to get them to add, so it will take a very very long time to scan in a large amount.

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Adam Capfer - August 13, 2025</b><br>
						The new update has made the collection and scanner unusable. The lists of cards no longer remember the order they were in and defaults to last added, the search functionality is much slower and harder to use, and there is no way to collapse the list of cards the way there was previously. Each card takes up a quarter of the screen, and always has a picture of the card when before you could see 10-12 cards at once.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Josebb Marquez - August 5, 2025</b><br>
						The app has been extremely buggy since the last update. Whenever you search a second time since opening the app, the search bar disappears and the whole screen goes blank. Sometimes when you try to type, it types everything backwards. Not even clearing the cache helps. Only work around is force closing the app, but having to do so for every single search becomes quite irksome to say the least.

						<b>Justin Dieters - August 3, 2025</b><br>
						When I try to create a new list or import a list, the menu shows up underneath my Home button so I cannot select it. I literally cannot make a list or import a list with the new app. This has severely impacted my ability to process lists from customers looking to sell cards to me. If I can't buy cards, I don't have cards to list on TCGplayer. Who the hell tested this thing? (Nobody, I'm guessing)

					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Travis Shirey (Shadow_plainswalker) - August 15, 2025</b><br>
						After the recent update this app is terrible. If you search a specific card with multiple printings it only displays 6 or 8 random versions with no option to find the correct one. You have to manually search for half the cards because it doesn't scan like it used to. When you save a list you can't add to it after. This app is 10 times worse than it was. It seems like all they want is for you to link to the site for purchases. Barely usable.

						<b>Stasi - August 6, 2025</b><br>
						Used to be my favorite app for scanning Magic and Pokémon, but as of yesterday's update it is next to useless. I own a brick and mortar game store myself, and do dozens of TCG sales/trades every day. This app used to allow me to scan 100 cards in just a few minutes, now it barely scans anything, and when it does you have to scroll through giant pictures and press it *hard* to select the one you need. Absolutely horrible, hope they go back to normal soon!

						<b>Erik Chumbley - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						Works fine for about a minute then the app stops responding every 5 seconds, prompting you to either wait or force close the program. This is probably the buggiest and most annoying app I have ever used, and they aren't fixing it. Do yourself a favor and just use a web browser instead. No need to download this garbage. UPDATE (8/2/2025) The app got worse with the latest update. Now, sometimes the screen goes blank while you're typing a search, and your query gets typed in backwards. Useless.

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Michael Harris - August 15, 2025</b><br>
						New scan update is a train wreck and I thought it was bad before. First it only scans about half the time no matter how I set it up even with a white paper behind the cards. The price doesn't adjust if you change the variant manually for foil vs normal. Scan pops up 4 variants only and then forces you to manually search if it didn't pick your variant. Not all variants are even in the system for several cards I have come across. I can't believe it was actually better before the update. (MTG only)
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Darren - August 7, 2025</b><br>
						This new update is the worst. It now takes twice as long to manually add cards. I may bump it up another star if the scanner actually worked without having to hold your mouth just right while dancing around light sources. I want an app to look up card prices, not do shopping. Please give back the old app! I didn't care much for that either, but it's leaps and bounds better than this current bad mashing of ones and zeros.

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Memnon ! - August 8, 2025</b><br>
						Absolute trash update. Its issues are seriously hurting my business. I literally just gave up on processing cards to write this. It takes about 3x longer to scan a card than before. No csv export option anymore. And the import to seller portal never worked but now it's the only hope of how I could possibly use the app to get cards in my inventory, and still doesn't work. Go back to being an app for business and don't try to be a collection app. Unbelievably stupid decision.

					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Justin Watts - August 11, 2025</b><br>
						Since the recent large update, this app has become extremely buggy and practically unusable for someone who simply creates collections of cards for valuation and organization purposes. I am constantly experiencing missing cards in my lists, lists that refuse to sort (and stay sorted), problems searching for cards that I could previously find with no issues, and much more. Also the lack of the list exporting controls that existed in the old version is unacceptable. This update seems half baked.

						<b>Christopher Jameson - August 7, 2025</b><br>
						The new update has hurt this app more than help. Scanning foiled cards is now next to impossible. As a seller, I'd upload photos of my higher $ cards. Can't figure out how to now. If the scanner is fixed and the option to sell a card is fixed, the potential of being a great app is there now that we do have the options to scan multiple TCGs, not just the couple it was able to scan before.

					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Evan Bosch - August 1, 2025</b><br>
						I love the app but there needs to be an option to simplify the collection screen so cards are on a single line so I can see 20 cards with no image and less clutter like the previous version. Give us the option. ALSO bring back the "view more data" button so we can see the recent sales history. It is impossible to know what vintage is really worth based on 1 recent sale. PLEASE!!!

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Miguel Pina-Broa - August 1, 2025</b><br>
						The simplicity of the previous version was well appreciated. You could see a list of your collection with the price quick to find and sharable. Now with the update for some reason TCGPlayer research thought people want to see pictures of the cards by default as their list, which is just bloat for no reason. Remove the images, enable being able to display list values by low/mid/market/direct low like we used to be able to and I'm sure this will be a good update.

						<b>John Michaud - July 31, 2025</b><br>
						The new version removed features and made the app slower to scan cards. I don't want to scroll through a list of every printing before the card is added. The first guess is usually correct and didn't make me confirm it. I don't want to store my collection on the cloud. I want to store it on my device like I was. Where did my collection go after the update? I had over 18k cards in my collection. I tried to migrate/download data and it failed. Guess I'll download an APK of an old version.

						<b>WolfPride - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						Loss of data when it comes to my lists of cards was very aggravating to see when I booted up the app. Even worse, now you are forcing users to make an account to use the app or else you don't get the same features as before? Yea. Not gonna happen. This is definitely not the way to go about things. Sincerely disappointed.

					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Mark Peters - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						The UI change has entirely destroyed the utility of the app. Not only does the scan function not work reliably anymore, the manual search function does not display every variant of the card anymore. When creating a list from the scanner, the market price does not update between foil and not, nor when set to a specific condition. To make matters worse, opening the shop through the app often crashes the entire thing, making the app literally worse than just opening the site in a browser.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<p style="color: white; font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 4px;">
						<b>Rex - August 5, 2025</b><br>
						The update made this app borderline unusable. The scanning feature doesn't work properly. Querying cards manually will occasionally cause the screen to go blank and stop working. Card prices are inaccurate when scanning. Displaying the card arts in the list was a great addition. eBay, you need to pay your application developer better or hire more to help fix all the bugs.

						<b>Ying Thor - August 2, 2025</b><br>
						Old version of this scanner app was a lot more usable. The upgrade was more of a big downgrade. Most cards are coming in as incorrect set or not even scanning anymore. I tried scanning old cards that used to scan on the old app and it doesn't even recognize them or just assign incorrect set. There is no longer a manual override to correct the set, it's just point and shoot and hope it gets it right, if not then delete and try again with 99% of the time getting the incorrect set.

						<b>Sarah "CQ" Miller - August 3, 2025</b><br>
						I loved this app before the July 28 update. It had dark mode, adding cards manually or adjusting info on scanned cards was simple and thorough, and the list view was much more visually appealing. I miss it. Now when I search cards especially cards that have been reprinted in multiple sets, the search returns some (6-8) but not all sets. It's so frustrating to use since the update.

						<b>Scott Sylvester - July 31, 2025</b><br>
						I had a whole bunch of different lists saved and now it was erased because I didn't have an account through TCGplayer set up. Now am forced to make one to save anything. This is just plain annoying. Call me a Karen but I am tired of making accounts for everything but more annoyed I lost all my data. Not cool. Not fun. App can't get the set down right so I have to update every time what set the card is from. Forget foils scanning. Borderless cards are extremely hard at scanning. Bad time.

						<b>Harley Davison - August 1, 2025</b><br>
						Updated the app, and it's absolutely useless now. I actually loved this app to price out trading cards, and find a good market and value to buy from. I absolutely hate it now, change it back. Do what you have to do to make it right again. Get the prices right, low, mid, and high. This app has become an utter disgrace and I will no longer be using it until it's fixed.

						<b>Ree Lee - August 1, 2025</b><br>
						This was a very useful app until it updated. Now it is utterly useless. I have been unable to scan a single card successfully since the update. I have been unable to trust any prices given by the app as when you change things like card condition, or failing, the prices remain the same all the time. Half the time a listing for market price doesn't even exist on a card. Transactions in my store that used to take 1 minute now take as long as 10 with this garbage update.

Way too bright but now when I search for cards it doesn't show the version I need. At the same time I can't filter it to just look for certain TCG types and I'm getting figurines and models thrown in as well. Please guys, if something isn't broke why would you try and fix it.

						This "app" is terrible. I put the word app in quotation marks because it's literally just a more buggy version of the mobile site. The absolute worst part is that I have to constantly log in with my email and password which is extremely annoying because the app won't save that information so I have to manually type it any time I can do anything.

						I'm REALLY not liking the new update. The previous software version handled better, scanning worked marginally better. Also, this BS about scanning cards... Slow, and VERY inefficient, scan and go is all but gone. You scan... wait... then need to pick the right version before moving on. Search is BAD. I search for card, then click on card, but trying to click the back arrow, or back button on the phone just white screens the app, or closes it completely.

						I really liked this app before the new update (July 2025). I will happily change my rating back to 5 stars if they fix some of the awful interface issues. When I sort my lists (or cards in a list), it doesn't save the sort so I have to redo it EVERY TIME I open the App. It was way more useful when I could see my lists without images so I could skim through my collection quickly and easily. This new format of always having thumbnails is awful. Choosing the price it is using is inconsistent.

						The recent overhaul they did to this app is the most detrimental I have seen any app do to itself. This went from being the best, most intuitive app on the market for cards, to abysmally awful. I and many others have switched to how we look up cards and prices. Whoever made this change and still thinks it's a positive, needs to be let go immediately, if this app can even be saved at this point and hasn't already lost enough people from the UI of this app jumping off a cliff.

						Horrible Update. They took a fine app and only made it worse. The old version had scanning issues, but it was easy to manually add it. Now, everything is harder to get added and find the correct card. It may be time to scrap TCG as the price index for traders. It really has become that awful. They would be best suited to revert back, scold the developers, and fire those that approved this updated version.

						Up until the most recent update, this was a great app. Not sure they tested the update before release, but it's become more of a hassle. Maybe I'm missing something, but there is no longer a link from your cards in your collection that opens the recent sales/data page. Once you've searched for a card in the "shop" section, any further clicks on the search area creates a blank white screen. Any additional typing in the search box comes up all jumbled. Only remedy is to close the app and restart.

						UPDATE IS TRASH! Cards rarely scan and never scan if there's any kind of sleeve. Can only set the condition for when scanning, the condition when searching is always Near Mint; then the price does not change when changing condition from Near Mint. The app is no longer showing the accurate market price (which is a hell of a problem), but this is also the case across most of the card scanning apps. The cards don't auto-scan a different language without adjusting the scanning parameters.

						Scanned about 450+ cards of a box of Tarkir: Dragonstorm only for there to be no obvious way to add/ensure the scanned list was added to the collection I created specifically for the scans. Inside the collection I made, I clicked scan and started adding. Once finished, I hit the back button thinking it would take me to my now populated collection, but that was not the case. The collection was empty. Clicked the "add" button again and the entire scanned list was gone.

						<b>Boxes - July 20, 2025</b><br>
						After this last update in July of 2025 the app became completely useless. You can’t organize lists in collection tracker by alphabet and have it stay that way. The versions buttons don't work so you can't find the cards you want. When the scanner works it doesn't give you all the options to choose the version of the card. There's no dark mode anymore. You can't choose list view without pictures of the cards in collection tracker. Trash now.

						The new update to the app has made the app more buggy than it was already before. The search bar now blanks out, then comes back and moves my cursor to the front of the type box while typing so it's impossible to spell a word correctly. Which then you have to force close the app to use again. Also I wish the search bar would not auto delete its text when the search is completed. Also not able to find the correct card to add on a list in the collection tab, just doesn't populate when searching.

						The old version of the app worked fine. The newest version is terrible. The scan somehow works worse than it used to. Manually inputting cards is now limited to TCGplayer’s top 10 recommendations which almost never has the card you are trying to put in. I used to reliably input cards faster and more accurately than scanning, but now manual input is not at all useful.

						This app is admittedly pretty bad. I love the platform but the app needs major improvement, especially after the most recent update.

						You can't track the price history of your cards or the performance of your portfolio/collection. The scanner will not work at all. Most sealed products and Japanese cards aren't available to add to your collection. Also, you can't add graded cards to your collection. Overall, it lacks these very significant features that other apps offer. The only positive to this app is that TCGplayer is the standard that everyone uses to determine a card's value.
