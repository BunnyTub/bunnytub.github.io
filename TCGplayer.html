				<h2>Why is this needed?</h2>
				<h3>
					The recent app update to TCGplayer has got everyone messed up.
					It's slow, it's buggy, it's unreliable, and is now one of the most quickly 1-star reviewed app among apps on the Google Play Store. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tcgplayer.tcgplayer">You should definitely take a look at the reviews on the Google Play Store, it's glorious.</a>
				</h3>

				<h2>What can I do?</h2>
				<h3>
					I've ripped a copy of TCGplayer off a friend's phone that was still running the pre-enshittification version of TCGplayer, and put it on my website for anyone to download. If you don't trust this upload, you can use tools such as Lucky Patcher to make your own backups of old app versions (somewhat advanced).
				</h3>

				<h2>There's a review topic named "absolute trash" now!</h2>

						Just got the update and man I wish I didn't. This has got to be the worst update ever in the history of updates. It's completely unusable now. It makes 0 sense. It doesn't scan cards right. Takes multiple times to scan. You can't change the card type after it's scanned, so if it scans wrong you have to delete and enter it manually. You don't have an easy-to-scroll list anymore. Why did they change it? I'll never understand companies that break things that were never broken.

						I work at a card shop and TCGplayers recent update has only made it much more difficult to scan and look up cards via the app. we used to have a feature that allowed us to correct printing if the scanner did not give the right printing but now its not even an option and the pop up option that brings up all the different prints will barely register a tap. I have a lot more complaints about the recent update but 500 characters isnt enough to go over it all. I will not be using this app until fixed
