			<h2><b>SharpAlert Privacy Policy | Effective 04/08/2025</b></h2>
            <h3>1. Information We Collect

				We collect and use the following types of data:
				
					API Calls: Our app makes calls to an external API (https://apps.fema.gov) to ensure the app functions as intended. These calls do not contain any personal information unless explicitly provided by you (e.g., API keys).
				
					Discord Webhook (Opt-In): If you choose to enable Discord webhook alerts, we send alert data to Discord. This data is limited to the alert content itself, and does not contain personal data. It may contain battery information where applicable.
				
				2. How We Use Your Information
				
				We use the data collected for the following purposes:
				
					To make necessary API (GET) calls that enable the app's functionality.
				
					To send alerts to your Discord channel if you opt-in for the webhook feature.
				
				We do not use your data for any other purposes.

				3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
				
				We respect your privacy and do not share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties. However, we may share information with:
				
					Discord: If you use the webhook feature, data will be sent to Discord. Discord's privacy policy governs how they handle this data.
				
				4. Security
				
				We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, so while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
				
				5. User Control
				
				You have full control over the data shared with our app:
				
					Discord Webhook: You can enable or disable the Discord webhook feature at any time.
				
					Opt-Out: You can choose not to use certain features (such as the Discord webhook), which means no data will be sent externally.
				
					Data Deletion: You can delete any save data stored locally on your device. Alerts are held in system memory (RAM) until the app is restarted, or exited from.
				
				6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
				
				We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, we will post the revised version on this page and update the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this page regularly to stay informed about how we protect your information.

				7. Contact Us
